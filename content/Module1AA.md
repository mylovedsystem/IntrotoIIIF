# Module 1: What is AudiAnnotate?


What is AudiAnnotate? and, why is it being discussed in a workshop together with IIIF? Those are very valid questions! **Module 1** will show how these two digital tools are related and how they can be helpful during your research endeavours!


By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Know what AudiAnnotate is
* Understand the use of AudiAnnotate in an academic setting


**Activity: Question** <br> When you see the word *annotate*, what do you think about? Is annotation restricted to written materials?

## Online Annotation

Annotation constitutes a fundamental element across various fields, including Digital Humanities. Annotation, in the realm of the Web, allows users to add, change, suggest or even remove information from a web-based material without modifying the resource itself.

Consider the annotations as an layer on top of a preexisting material, a layer that is usually visible for other users who share the same annotation system. In this sense, web annotation functions as a variant of social software tool.

Now, we frequently tend to associate online annotation with written works.<br> 

In fact, given the advance of digital tools and the currrent omnipresence of audio and video in academia, annotation is now an action that we can perform on online materials beyond texts. <br> 

This type of online annotationallows researchers, professors, students and the public to add, modify and share already-existing audio and video materials, thus enhancing and expanding the characteristics that the original material has. It allows to make the material more engaging to an outside audience through the scholars' added interpretation.

## AudiAnnotate 

AudiAnnotate is a project that aims to make audio or video materials and their annotations more accessible and usable for researchers and the public. This tool is a relatively straightforward and uncomplicated way to transform their analyses of audiovisual content into annotations.

It uses the [IIIF](https://mylovedsystem.github.io/IntrotoIIIF/content/Module1IIIF.html#module-1-what-is-iiif) v.3 standard and the W3C Web Annotation standard to create, publish, and share annotations on audio or video collections. 

## Why is AudiAnnotate helpful?


Annotating a text document is a basic activity that allows reviewers to give feedback on a Word document or a PDF document. However, <u>annotating audio and video files</u> is more difficult.

**AudiAnnotate** is a tool that lets you add annotation to audio or video files. It does this by linking the file with the comments in a sensible way. 

You can then share, present, and reuse the commented version with others, without changing the original file.
