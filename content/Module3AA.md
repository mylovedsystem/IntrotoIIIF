# Extra: Using Hypothesis


[**Hypothesis**](https://web.hypothes.is/){:target="_blank"} is a way of **adding comments**, **questions**, or **feedback** to any online content, such as web pages, documents, or videos. 

It is a form of **social annotation**, which means that you can share your annotations with others and see what they have annotated as well. 

Hypothesis can be used for various purposes, such as **learning**, **teaching**, **research**, or **discussion**. 

You can use Hypothesis to **annotate anything online** with **classmates**, **colleagues**, or **friends**. You can also join groups to collaborate on annotations with specific communities or topics.

When people access an AudiAnnotate annotation webpage, they can **collaborate by creating annotations for text on webpages**, sharing them, and replying to othersâ€™ annotations.
