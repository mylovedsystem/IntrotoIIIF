## The Key Purpose of IIIF

In addition to being **a digital tool**, it is helpful to think of the IIIF as **a community**. <br> Museums, educational archives, and libraries are taking part in this community, sharing their visual aids within one tool. IIIF calls this community the _**IIF Consortium (IIIF-C)**_ 





 
The IIIF is a digital tool that allows its users to **view images of artworks**, while also conducting various actions with/to the image. 

These capabilities include **enhanced zoom**, **color manipulation**, and **positioning images** next to one another for comparison purposes. In the compare-and-contrast function, the image quality remains unaltered. IIIF also allows the user to **annotate the image**.
