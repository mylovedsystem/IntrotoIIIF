# Module 1: What is IIIF?


At this point, you must be wondering **what IIIF is** and what its different feautures are. **Module 1** will walk you through the basics of the IIIF digital tool!


By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Explain the key purpose of IIIF
2. Understand the IIIF Manifest
3. Recognize the four APIs of IIIF



**Activity: Reflection** <br> Take a few moments to consider the digital tools you have used in the past to look up artworks. What did you like about those tools? What were their limitations? How could they have been improved?

## The Key Purpose of IIIF

In addition to being **a digital tool**, it is helpful to think of the IIIF as **a community**.

Museums, educational archives, and libraries are taking part in this community, sharing their visual aids within one tool. IIIF calls this community the _**IIIF Consortium (IIIF-C)**_

Stemming from the Consortium members, the IIIF allows its users to **view images of artworks**, while also conducting various actions with/to the image. 

These capabilities include **enhanced zoom**, **color manipulation**, and **positioning images** next to one another for comparison purposes. In the compare-and-contrast function, the image quality remains unaltered. IIIF also allows the user to **annotate the image**. 


It is helpful to think of IIIF as a *set of standards* for sharing, viewing, comparing and manipulating images.

## The IIIF Manifest


The IIIF functions as a repository of images (a virtual place where all the images are stored).
 
To achieve this function, IIIF relies on the **the Manifest**. 

The Manifest is the “package” which contains links to the resources that make up the image item. The Manifest takes the form of **a URL** that leads to an online document (in the format of JSON). Ultimately, the IIIF Manifest is the viewing object, itself. It is the object that is viewable through certain digital tools. 

**Definition of URL** <br> 
Uniform Resource Locator. We can think of URLs as the website address that we enter into the search bar. For example: https://ubc-library-rc.github.io

For the purposes of this module, it is important to understand that **the JSON can be read and displayed by IIIF**. 
 
### IIIF Manifest Viewers 

There are at least a dozen tools to view the IIIF Manifest. Some of the most-widely known and used viewers are:

⋅⋅* Mirador
⋅⋅* Universal Viewer (UV)
⋅⋅* Tify
⋅⋅* IIIF Curation Viewer 
⋅⋅* Diva.js. 


In a later part of this module, we will be engaging with the viewer known as Mirador.
