# Module 2: Why use IIIF?

Now that we have covered the basics of IIIF and studied its main features, let us explore the utility of this digital tool.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*  Recognize the utility of IIIF in your research
*  Recognize the utility of IIIF in your classroom teaching and presentations

## The Utility of IIIF in Art Research

IIIF has become **a large digital repository** that allows for **uniform access** to the images that are hosted in the various sites (Consortium members) that cooperate with IIIF. 
 
Per a document prepared by the **UBC School of Library, Archival and Information Studies** (November 2017), IIIF’s “main value consists in enabling collaboration with other institutions and making possible **linked data initiatives**.” 
 
One of the most valuable features of IIIF is **image annotation **.

In other words, you can make notes on the image while you are viewing the image. This includes:

*       The ability to draw directly on the image
*       In an oval, rectangular, freeform, or polygonal shape (size and dimensions determined by the user), you can write text within that created shape
*       The text can be bold, italic, or set to a colour; text can be indented to the left or right 
*       The ability to embed another image/media or link directly into the annotation 
*       The annotation can be given a fill colour
