# Module 3: How to Use IIIF (at-a-glance)

Now, let us have a hands-on exploration of IIIF.
 
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
*       Pull up an image on IIIF using the Mirador viewer 
*       Create an oval annotation on image through IIIF using the Mirador viewer
*       Recognize and be able to use most, if not all, of the dynamic functions of IIIF through the Mirador viewer

Before you begin, try a search to find out if the art institution which houses your artwork is already utilizing IIIF. <br>
[Here is a website](https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/) that has a large list of art collecitions around the world. <br>
However, please note that, as things change frequently, it may be more useful to just do trial and error to check.

## Pulling up Images: An Example

The following steps will show you how to pull up an image from one of the art collections and how to reuse it through IIIF. 

For the purpose of this example, we will use the **Harvard Art Museum** collection as an example. [Click on this link](https://harvardartmuseums.org) and then follow these steps:
 
Step 1
{: .label .label-step}
Click on “**Collections**.”
{: .step} 

Step 2
{: .label .label-step}
In the search box, type: “Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec At the Circus Jockey,” and press enter.
{: .step}  

Step 3
{: .label .label-step}
This should generate one result: a drawing by Toulouse-Lautrec, titled “**At the Circus: Jockey**.”
{: .step} 

Step 4
{: .label .label-step}
Click on this result. It should take you to a new page featuring this drawing.
{: .step} 

Step 5
{: .label .label-step}
Beneath the drawing, you will see a number of icons. If you **hover over the fifth icon** (the IIIF icon), it will state “**Reuse via IIIF**.” Click on that icon. 
{: .step} 

Step 6
{: .label .label-step}
It will open a new window with the drawing set against a dark background. 
{: .step}

**You are now viewing the image through IIIF!** The IIIF window has opened through the **Mirador Viewer **

**What is Mirador?**<br> Consider the IIIF object as built by [**JSON**][id1] :
Museums and libraries can deliver their images through an IIIF viewer. As noted in Module 2, there are many IIIF viewers, but Mirador is the one that is used by the Harvard Art Museum. UBC, for instance, uses the Open Collections viewer.

[id1]: ## "The name for the file format, or a way to transmit data"

## The Mirador Viewer Interface

Let’s now return to the Toulouse-Lautrec drawing presented by the Mirador viewer on the Harvard Art Museum’s website. 
 
At the very top of the page, there are four icons:

1. The first is labeled **Get JSON.** As noted, this is the name of the file format, which** you can copy and paste**.
 
2. To the right, you will see another icon, **Get Annotations.** If there are any annotations, this is where they will be located.
 
3. The remaining two icons are **Change Layout** and **Full Screen**.
 
4. The line below will state the title of the work “**At the Circus: Jockey (Au cirque: Jockey)**.”
 
5. To the left of the title, there are two icons: <br>

6. If you hover over **the first icon**, it will drop down to give you the following options:

   * To replace the image with another one
   * To move it into a left/right/top/bottom slot for image comparison – this is when you have more than one image opened via IIIF and want to see both images at the same time. <br>
    
8. If you hover over **the second icon**, it will toggle to open a side panel. In this side panel, there are options for “Index,” “Search” and “Layers.” For the purpose of this module, you can try to adjust the visibility under “Layers” – decreasing the opacity from 100% to less opaque. <br>
9. To the far right of this line, there are three icons:

![image](https://github.com/mylovedsystem/IntrotoIIIF/assets/140271862/c04f52ef-0a76-4192-91c1-a3fda7b4b53b)
   
* The first permits you to change how you view the image (image view, scroll view, or gallery view).
* The second icon allows you to “View information/metadata about this object.” This provides details of the image in point form, including the art object’s dimensions or height/weight, and credit line.
* The third icon permits you to view the image in full screen (identical to the icon directly above it).

In summary, viewing an image through IIIF permits a number of dynamic possibilities that are well suited to research, presentation, and pedagogy.
