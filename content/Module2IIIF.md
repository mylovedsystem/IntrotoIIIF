# Module 2: Why use IIIF?

Now that we have covered the basics of IIIF and studied its main features, let us explore the utility of this digital tool.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*  Recognize the utility of IIIF in your research
*  Recognize the utility of IIIF in your classroom teaching and presentations

## The Utility of IIIF in Art Research

IIIF has become **a large digital repository** that allows for **uniform access** to the images that are hosted in the various sites (Consortium members) that cooperate with IIIF. 
 
Per a document prepared by the **UBC School of Library, Archival and Information Studies** (November 2017), IIIF’s “main value consists in enabling collaboration with other institutions and making possible **linked data initiatives**.” 

### Image Annotation with IIIF
 
One of the most valuable features of IIIF is **image annotation **.

In other words, you can make notes on the image while you are viewing the image. This includes:

*       The ability to draw directly on the image
*       In an oval, rectangular, freeform, or polygonal shape (size and dimensions determined by the user), you can write text within that created shape
*       The text can be bold, italic, or set to a colour; text can be indented to the left or right 
*       The ability to embed another image/media or link directly into the annotation 
*       The annotation can be given a fill colour

## The Utility of IIIF In Classroom Teaching and Presentations

The uses of IIIF in the classroom setting are diverse. Particularly through the **Mirador viewer** (which will be discussed in Module 3), IIIF has great utility in classroom teaching involving visual arts. 
 
### Annotation

In terms of presenting an image of an artwork on a projector to the class, the instructor can **use IIIF to annotate the image** (identify areas of interest, relay notes etc.)

### Compare and Contrast

IIIF via the Mirador viewer is also quite useful for **comparing and contrasting images**, which is a common form of slide presentation in Art History and other art-related disciplines. 

This method of visual presentation is valuable not only for teaching (showing two images side by side), but **also for learning assessment** (such as a slide comparison during a final exam).

In summary, the utility of IIIF encompasses both teaching and learning.
